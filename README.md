# Phi-2 DialogSum Fine-tuned

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for fine-tuning the Phi-2 model on the DialogSum dataset.

## Project Overview
The notebook is designed to train a large language model using the [DialogSum dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/neil-code/dialogsum-test). It leverages Hugging Face Transformers and other machine learning libraries to enhance the model's ability to summarize dialogues effectively.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Hugging Face Transformers
- PyTorch
- ROUGE Score for evaluation
- Other standard ML libraries

## Usage
To run the notebook:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook phi-2-dialogsum-finetuned.ipynb
```
